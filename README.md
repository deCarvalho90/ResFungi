# ResFungi
Profile of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) specific for fungal resistance genes (ResFungi.hmm).

This repository contains an HMM profile for fungal genes that contain known mutations that confer resistance to antifungal drugs.
This profile contains information for genes with mutations that confer resistance to:
Caspofungin, Micafungin, Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Voriconazole.

As more antifungal genes are described this database will be updated.
